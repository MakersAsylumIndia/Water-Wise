# 📘 Welcome to the IS Project Documentation Template!

Hey there! 👋

This repository is our home for documenting our **Innovation School Project** and starting our **maker portfolio**.  
We’ll be using the **GitHub Wiki** to update all our project details in a structured format.

## 🧠 What to Do First

 **brief introduction**

🔹 The problem we are solving?  
Urban homes lack consistent plant care when owners are away. This system automates watering based on soil moisture levels. The owners can also manually water their plants from any distance.
🔹 What’s our proposed solution?
Our project called Water Wise enables users to water their plants remotely using a manual or automatic mode. It measures the moisture content in a plant and accordingly waters it when the levels are low.
