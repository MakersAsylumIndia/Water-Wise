# ðŸ“˜ Welcome to the IS Project Documentation Template!

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

This repository is our home for documenting our **Innovation School Project** and starting our **maker portfolio**. 

## Problem Statement
Urban homes lack consistent plant care when owners are away. This system automates watering based on soil moisture levels. The owners can also manually water their plants from any distance.

## Solution
Our project, called Water Wise, enables users to water their plants remotely using a manual or automatic mode. It measures the moisture content in a plant and accordingly waters it when the levels are low.
